This is my first post in The Grid. I'll admit I'm not as hyped about this as I was when I first heard about it. That was a LONG time ago and the project team significantly missed their launch dates, which doesn't make me very confident in how this will play out.

However, this is still a cool new technology, and you all know I love to geek out on new tech. So here's the first post.
